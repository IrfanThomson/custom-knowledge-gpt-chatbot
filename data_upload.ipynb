       " 'Rob Walling: And I’m Rob.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: And we’re here to share our experiences to help you avoid the same mistakes we’ve made.  So Rob, exactly why are we here again?\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: I have no idea!  We’ve decided to do some crazy thing and record a podcast; something that neither of us have ever done.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Well, that’s true, but I think that the important thing that we are really here for is to share the things that we’ve done in the past and, most importantly, share the mistakes that we’ve made over the past several years in building out our product portfolios and building up our companies.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Yeah, and I think along with the mistakes come the successes as well, right?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I hope so!  [laughs]\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: I mean we’ve learned from both of them.  Yeah, I guess if we didn’t have any successes, no one should listen to us.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Why exactly are we developing this podcast?  I mean does the world really need another podcast about startups?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: You know, like we talked about before, there is this obvious gap in the market.  There are a lot of podcasts aimed at venture backed startups, high growth startups, but there are so few podcasts aimed at bootstrap startups.  And frankly, the ones that I listen to, they don’t tend to have super practical information that you can apply to your startup or micro ISV right away.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'There are a lot of interview podcasts, and there is a lot of information that is just floating around, kind of almost superficial stuff that you hear on blogs, and I am hoping we can go a little more in depth with ours.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Definitely.  I mean I think that is the key point here is that we can try to go a little bit further than what you would find on a blog.  I mean the point of a blog is partially for information, but some of it is entertainment as well.  And to get the right information you need, you tend to go to a lot of different blogs or a lot of different websites.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And one of the key things we would like to bring to the table and share with our listeners is the experience that we’ve had, the things that we’ve done that maybe didn’t work out so well, and then the things that we’ve done in the past that did work out pretty well, and try to collectively show a lot of that information all in one spot.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: We don’t intend this to be another show that interviews startup founders.  There are a lot of those, and I think most of us probably listen to them.  So we are not going to be duplicating that format.  We may have an interview once in a while, but that is not going to be the gist of it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Individually, you and I have been through a lot as entrepreneurs. And, you know, obviously our goal is to provide real world strategies that have worked for our businesses that ideally will help someone else who is listening to the podcast.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Right.  That’s the goal.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: OK.  Let’s get started by introducing ourselves.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: My name is Mike Taber and I am the founder of both Moon River Software and Moon River Consulting.  I am based in the greater Boston area.  I work for myself fulltime.  And I have been self employed since around 2005.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'I used to work for a company called Pedestal Software that got acquired by Altiris back in 2005 for somewhere around $65 million or so.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Holy smokes!  I hope you got a fat check off of that!\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I got 0.0001%, and it was actually a little less than that.  I did the math on it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Wait, 65…1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3…\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: It was about $8,000, so you don’t have to do the math.  But needless to say, somebody made out a lot better than I did.  So the number sounds big, but that kind of pushed me over the edge and I said, “You know what?  Why should I be doing all this work to let somebody else be reaping the rewards?”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And, you know, that is why I started Moon River software and eventually spun off Moon River Consulting out of it.  I just didn’t want to be in the position where I was making other people loads of money.  I mean I am a smart guy, or at least reasonably smart.  My wife tells me otherwise.  But, you know, that is what I wanted to do.  I wanted to be master of my own destiny.  And I’ve said that to several other people, and at the end of the day, that is just what it comes down to.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So what about you Rob?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Well, I followed a similar path, actually.  Over the past 10 years, I’ve had a couple of salary positions, but mostly I’ve done software consulting.  And whether that is for a firm that I was paid hourly through, or I spun off my own firm in 2002 that eventually went fulltime a couple years later.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And I realized pretty quickly that consulting is fun, but I had a tough time building things for other people.  I enjoyed it, but it really wasn’t fulfilling me the way that I wanted my work life to do.  So I started building my own products and launching them.  And pretty quickly I found a couple other products that people had launched that weren’t doing well and acquired them.  And I started learning the ropes of marketing software, essentially, on a very small scale, obviously.  I am not Microsoft.  I mean it is me, one guy, and a couple of contractors I have, or a handful of contractors, I should say.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But I found that I enjoyed it pretty quickly, although I blew through…Man, I blew through a ton of money early on!  I don’t know if I ever told you, but I dropped $1,200 on Adwords in six weeks one time and I made one $99 sale off of it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I blew like $1,500 in a month before, so I know what you are talking about.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Yeah.  Totally, you just have no idea what you are doing.  And looking back, I still have the campaign saved, and I look at it and I am like, “What in the hell was I thinking?”  It is not set up very well at all.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So anyway, I own a handful of software products, and I build them, I acquire them, and I market them, and I really enjoy it.  And that is what I do fulltime now.  So I think it is like you: master of my own destiny or master of my own domain, as they like to say, if you have seen Seinfeld.  [laughs]\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: [laughs]  So I guess one of the things that we wanted to discuss son our first podcast was exactly what is a micropreneur, because that was one of the things that you and I had come up with a while back, and just came up with the idea and definition of a micropreneur.  And it is not something I have heard anybody else really talk about.  It is just something we kind of spawned off on our own.  It sort of makes sense.  So why don’t you kind of explain to everybody what a micropreneur is.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Sure.  A micropreneur is a word that we made up, essentially.  But after we made it up, we found out, of course, other people were using it in different contexts.  But essentially what we focused on is a micropreneur as a technical individual, someone with technical skill, and that can typically be software development or web development skill, and someone who wants to launch small software businesses.  And whether that is a downloadable software product, like something that you write and runs on a desktop, like time tracking, or an invoicing app, even a game, or it can be a software as a service application, or an iPhone app, a Blackberry app.  I mean kind of anything that you can code up that someone will pay you for.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'I have owned things ranging from an ecommerce site, to an e-book, to software products, to software as a service applications, a niche job website.  I mean kind of all this stuff fits under this umbrella of a micropreneur-something that you can build and sell online.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And a micropreneur is the person behind that.  Some people might be confused by: What is a micropreneur versus a micro ISV?  And a micro ISV is a one person software company, whereas the micropreneur is the person behind that micro ISV.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'We are going to be using that word a lot in this podcast and in the future.  So today we are going to talk about six tenants that you and I put together that essentially try to define what a micropreneur actually is.  Let’s get started.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: So the first tenant of being a micropreneur is:  a micropreneur is a technical entrepreneur who writes software that creates value for a niche market.  You can choose to write games, you can make downloadable software that gets installed on somebody’s machine, or you can do software as a service.  It could be something like building comic book creation software.  It could be software that is used for creating bingo cards.  Just about anything is game for a micropreneur to be creating.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Right.  And I think the key part of tenant one is that it is a niche market.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: You are not going to build a Microsoft Word, but you might build a word processor that is designed for people who need to write a master’s thesis or a PhD dissertation-something along those lines.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Yep.  So it is finding and choosing a niche.  Since we are only one person, you can’t possibly take on a huge company.  And tenant two is:  a micropreneur starts with a single product or website but may build or require more once he or she has learned how to market software.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And this is an interesting one, because a lot of developers don’t think in terms of having multiple products.  And they think that they are going to find a niche and build a comic book cataloguing software, and that it is going to make 10 grand a month, or five grand a month, or whatever they need to live on. Typically, that doesn’t happen.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But often, you can build something that maybe generates a lot less than that.  And if you stack enough of them together, then you can actually build up a reasonable amount of income.  This is not for everyone.  Certainly, some developers are going to just want to do one product, and that is going to be their goal, and that is totally fine.  But we have really talked about the goal, for a lot of people, is going to be to do multiple products.  And as a result, there will have to be some automation involved, because, you know, you can’t manage five products and do everything all by yourself.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: And that is actually a good leading to tenant number three, because tenant number three is: a micropreneur is intent on staying small.  Now, small is something you have to define for yourself.  Is small a one person company?  You are going to be a one employee company for however long you want to run the business?  Or do you want to grow it out to two or three people?  Or do you have a couple of friends who have jumped on board with you and decided to build out whatever the product or products are that you have decided to build?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But essentially, the micropreneur is intent on staying small.  And that is in direct contrast to things like venture capital startups or Angel investor startups who want to build out a company and build it as largely as they can and as quickly as they can in order to make a lot of money and cash out.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: And tenant four is:  A micropreneur is a highly technical entrepreneur who values time, location, or income independence.  Again, some developers, some micropreneurs, may value only one of these things.  Some may value all three of them.  And let me step through each of them.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Time independence is the ability to be in control of your own time.  So as a consultant, even if you work from home, you tend to have to work between nine and five or nine and nine as a lot of us did when we were consulting.  Time independence is if you have a software product that you really don’t have any kind of working hour constraints; that you can work weekends and you can work nights, and you can do all types of crazy stuff.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Location independence is when you can live anywhere you want.  And then income independence, of course, is being much more in control of your own income streams.  So it is not relying on a salary or even consulting clients.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Now, you are never, of course, completely, 100% in charge of your income, because it depends on the market and what is selling.  But if you have a product and it sells to 20, 30, 40, 50 people a month, you are really not controlled by any one person anymore.  And that is really the crux of income independence, is you are not beholden to a single entity for the majority of your income.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And as you build or acquire more products, you become less and less beholden not only to each individual customer, but to each individual product.  So you just have a lot more diversification.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And as I said before, some people will value one or two of these and others really will make it a goal to achieve all three of them.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Tenant number five is:  A micropreneur merges existing technical knowledge with online marketing knowledge.  In order to succeed as a micropreneur, you really need to be able to combine technical knowledge with that marketing knowledge.  And if you don’t, what is going to happen is you are going to build a great product, but nobody is going to buy it because you are not able to market it effectively.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And the opposite is true as well.  If you have great marketing knowledge but no technical ability, it is very difficult to build a great product that people are going to want to buy.  So if you are able to merge both of these things, then what you have is a very, very powerful combination that not a lot of developers or marketers are going to be able to match, because it is very difficult to build up both of those silos of knowledge, I will say.  And most of us went to school for development and we know how to develop software, and we could do it in our sleep, but it is really the marketing side that is a lot more challenging because there are many things that are just not well defined in terms of the problem space.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So, for example, if something is wrong in your code, if you got a bug, you know what the parameters are around that bug.  You know exactly what is going on.  And you may not necessarily know why, but you can step it through the debugger and figure all that stuff out.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'If something is wrong on your website and you are just not getting traffic, it could be a million different things.  And it is just as bad, if not worse than a technical problem, where, you know, you have a finite space of where this problem could be.  With a website where the entire Internet could be hitting it or, in this particular case, is not hitting it, you have to figure out why, and it could be just about anything.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And being able to clearly identify what those sources of problems are is really what is going to separate a micropreneur from the average off the street developer who can certainly code his way out of a wet paper bag, but isn’t necessarily going to be able to figure out those problems.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Yeah.  I think this is a really important tenant, and I think it is one that a lot of developers don’t think about.  We totally underestimate how important and how difficult it is to learn the marketing side of things.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Tenant six is: A micropreneur is a cross between four things: a software developer, a webmaster, a marketer, and an entrepreneur.  We all know what a developer is. A webmaster, the reason you have to have this in your blood, or learn it, or learn to outsource it is that we are talking about selling online.  And even today, iPhone, Blackberry apps that don’t run on the web need some type of sales site or sales information.  So you are going to have to know or learn something about getting a nice website up.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And the last two are a marketer and an entrepreneur.  And these are the ones that take a lot of time to learn and a lot of trial and error.  And, of course, Mike, that is what you and I have spent the last 10 years learning, right?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Oh yeah!\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Those are the ones that cost you money.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Time.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Time.  Tons of time.  Yeah.  And you can learn some of it from books.  It is like coding, right?  You can learn some of it from books, but you need to have a lot of experience doing it as well.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And so the marketing part is learning how to get the word out and get people interested in your product.  And the entrepreneur is the person with the vision, and it is the person who can kind of make everything happen, whether they are doing a lot of the work themselves or whether they are just being the visionary and outsourcing them as they go along.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So those are the four things that would be great if they were four different people each gifted in those areas.  But realistically, as a micropreneur, all four of them-one person.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: So now that we’ve kind of talked about exactly what constitutes a micropreneur and what it takes to be a micropreneur, one of the things that we also wanted to talk about was what a micropreneur is not.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: You know, the first thing that a micropreneur is not at all is not an Internet “get rich quick” scheme.  A, you are not going to get rich, B, you are not going to do it quickly, and C, it is not a scheme at all.  So it just has nothing to do with any of that stuff.  I mean it really is a long term mentality of taking technical knowledge and applying it in an intelligent, formatted manner, and learning from experience, and, over a long term, building up one or more viable businesses that hopefully generate some income for you and provides some level of independence.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And again, whether that independence you want is just to have a couple hundred bucks a month to help make a car payment, or if ultimately you want to quit your job, that is going to take a couple of years, right?  But it is not anything like an Internet “get rich quick” scheme or a work from home scheme or any of that stuff that you hear about online or on late night TV.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: A second thing that we wanted to point out that a micropreneur is not about is being a micropreneur is not about venture backed startups or very high growth startups.  It has absolutely nothing to do with any of these large or high competition niche markets.  If you wanted to try and create the next word processor, going about it in as a micropreneur is really not a…I don’t even think it is a viable option, to be perfectly honest.  I don’t even know how well Google is doing at it with their Google Docs against Microsoft.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Venture capitalists have portfolios of products, so they can afford for 10 or 20 of them to fail because they have the one that returns such a huge return for them.  But when you are an entrepreneur, your portfolio is one company.  Or, in our case, maybe it is a few small companies.  But realistically, if you are going to go for the venture backed route, you are going to have one company at a time, and it is going to take you 3-5 years to do it, and it is going to take a lot of work and a lot of passion and effort out of you.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So how many of those are you going to be able to do in your whole life?  You know, maybe two or three tops?  And if the first two fail, you may not come back for a third.  So it really is an odds game, and the odds are just stacked against you too far for us to consider the venture world viable.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So that is why, when we look at micropreneurship, the odds of you succeeding, if you do it right, and if you do it smart, are very high.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I almost look at a micropreneur as essentially a mini VC or mini Angel who has all these different products in their portfolio.  And if one of them does great and five of them do bad, no big deal, because you have got that one product that is doing well.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And if you make these products that are small enough that address a problem in the market, something is going to do well.  All it takes is doing the research, doing your homework.  And essentially, what you are doing is you are spreading out your risks among all these different products.  And if you get a product that only pulls in $25 a month, well, OK.  Well, no big deal.  But for every product that you have like that, how many others is it going to take before you find one that gets $1,000 month or two or three thousand dollars a month?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And the more of these small applications that you crank out, the better your chances are.  And essentially, you become that mini VC of your product portfolio.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[music]\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: One of the reasons that Rob and I started to put together this podcast was because, individually, we have gotten a lot of questions over the years about: How do you go about finding a market?  How do you go about selling your products?  How is it that you have gotten successful and been able to do the things that you have done?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And today what we have is a question from somebody who asked us.  Here is his question.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Aaron:  Hi guys.  This is Aaron.  I have a question about competition today.  I think a lot of people, including myself, get caught up in the discovery phase.  At least for me, it has a lot to do with wanting to find that slam dunk-that product that is almost guaranteed to be a success.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'What I am finding out is if there is a market for some kind of software product, chances are someone else is already out there offering a solution, and an even greater chance that there are multiple solutions.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So my question is: How much competition is too much competition?  And in a related question: How do you compete with free, or do you?  Thanks.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: So Rob, why don’t you take a first crack at that one?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: So the first part is: How much competition is too much competition?  In my experience, there is too much competition when the cost to acquire a customer is more than you are going to make from that customer.\\n',\n",

       " 'So if you have a 1% conversion rate, meaning you sell to one customer out of every 100 that come to your website, and your product is a $100 product, that means that every visitor to your website is worth $1.  And if it costs you more than $1 to send people to your website, that means there is too much competition in the niche.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I think my take on it is that determining how much competition is too much competition is more of a judgment call based on your own personality as well.  There are cases where going into a particular niche, there is a lot of competition and there is substantial competition.  But if you feel that you can overcome the hurdles to garner attention from the people out there searching for whatever that solution is, by all means, go for it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But you do have to do your homework.  You do have to do the research and make absolutely sure that you are going to be tolerant of the risks that you are undertaking in that particular market.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Right.  And I think a key point that both of us made there is neither of us emphasized “if you can build a better product.”  That has something to do with it, but not a ton.  Right?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: [laughs] Yeah.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Really, the key factor is the marketing side of it-getting people to your website.  Because you can build a better product and, frankly, no one is going to care.  No one is going to hear about it.  You have to look at the economics of the marketing.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'To get a little more specific, Mike, you and I have talked about the cost of acquiring a customer.  And it is like if you are a developer and you don’t have a site, you don’t have a product, how do you figure that out?  And there are a couple of tools that you and I both used.  One is the Google Adwords keyword tool where you can search on a term.  And then you have to go to the exact phrase match.  A lot of people go to the broad match.  You go to the exact phrase match and kind of peek around and get a relative idea, although this thing can be off by an order of magnitude.  But get a relative idea of how many people are looking for particular search phrases.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And the other tool that I’ve used that works really well is SpyFu.com.  It helps you not only at…If there is competition in a niche, it helps you look at the keywords that they are ranking for and pulling in traffic for.  It also gives you an idea of the Google AdWords they are running and the cost they are paying for them.  So you can pretty quickly see: “Oh, they are paying $5 per click because they are in the wedding niche.  So I really need to have a high conversion rate and an expensive product in order to make it viable.”\\n',\n",

       " 'Mike: So the second part of this question was:  How do you compete with free, or do you?  And I think that that is a much more difficult question to answer, mainly because it depends so much on who you are competing against and what the specific product is.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'For example, there are a lot of products that Google offers.  I would not want to be in the business of trying to resell email at this point.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: But at the same time, there are also tons of email providers out there that are still making money because they actually have value.  And this is the key part that I want to drill into, because I think that in the vast majority of cases-we can use email as a great example-you really are going to have a hard time competing with Google trying to offer email services, because theirs are free.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'However, personally, I outsource my email.  And I actually have a hosted solution that I pay for because I get Exchange Server with it.  And it has all these advanced features and functionality that I like to use.  And I honestly like having Exchange Server running behind my business.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So, for me, it works.  And for the company that I am purchasing it from, they are obviously making money off of this, and they are reselling Exchange Email to me and making money off of it, and are successfully competing against Google.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: I think that there are niches around where there may be a free provider that isn’t doing a very good job, and that you can come in and compete with them.  I think the way to tell the difference is that if there is someone with venture capital in their back pocket and they are offering a free service, you don’t want to enter that market, because they have deep, deep pockets and you are not going to outgun them on features.  You are one person and they probably have a team of developers.  And they are using a freemium model, which is very difficult to get to work for micropreneurs.  You have to have massive scale.\\n',\n",

I saw Eric Sink from SourceGear answer basically the same question from a college student:  “Well, why should I purchase a license for SourceGear when I can go out and get Subversion or any of these other open source version control systems for free?”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And his answer was basically that because buying SoureGear’s…you know, whether you are buying Vault or whether you are buying Fortress, that saves you time and money.  And the reason it saves you time and money is because your time as a developer is worth something.  And the only time that going after those open source solutions where it is going to benefit you is if your time is “worthless”.

They want to be able to call somebody and say, “Hey, your software isn’t working.  How do I fix it?  I’ve paid you for whatever the license fees are.”  And they expect support.

If you go to a website, or if you are playing games, if you are using Word or various parts of Office, or Skype, or writing email, what have you, this software tracks and categorizes all of the different pieces of software that you use.  And it assigns values to them to say how productive it thinks that you are being.\\n',\n",

You can have it set for 24 hours a day usage or only between working hours, etc.  But because, as a micropreneur, you only have a limited time, typically, as you start, you have got maybe 10 or 15 hours a week that you can dedicate to being a micropreneur and to building up your products.  So you want to maximize the effectiveness of that time.\\n',\n",

And looking at my most recent efficiency rating, your efficiency can be rated anywhere from negative two to positive two.  Email tends to be neutral-it tends to be a rating of zero. Games, I think, are negative two.  Something like your IDE’s for development, those tend to be plus two.  And you can customize each of these.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[03:48] Mike: Yes.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[03:49] Rob: So Mike and I sat down and we’ve had a lot of discussions about starting software companies, launching products, and there are a lot of misunderstandings going on, maybe, in the developer community.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:01] Some people launch products for the right reasons, but most of us, the first one, we do it for the wrong reasons.  And so given our experience, we came up with three reasons that we wanted to share with everyone.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:11] Reason number one is: having a product idea.  And just having a product idea is a bad reason to try to start a software company.  And the reason is that there is a big difference between a software product and a software project.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:27] Software projects are things that you build for fun, right?  And you have this product idea and it is going to be fun to build; you want to use a piece of technology, typically is what the emphasis is.  Whereas a software product is something that is actually commercially viable.  It is something that someone will pay money for.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:44] And it is so easy to confuse these two things — product and project.  And it is easy to fall into the trap of looking at a cool, new technology like WPF or even AJAX a few years ago and to say, “Man, what can I build with this?” rather than just start from a market need and to ask, “What would people pay money for?” and then going backwards and actually building that.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:08] Those ideas tend to be a little more boring frankly. Not as exciting. They don’t ignite our developer passion as much as using this cool new technology. So just having a product idea is not a very good reason to launch a product.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:21] Mike: A lot of things that I’ve seen and, quite frankly, done in the past, I guess distant past, thankfully, a lot of what I had done was just look at something somebody else had done or was in the middle of doing and say, “Oh. I could do that.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:32] I think about the number one example in my mind is Ebay. How many people who are listening to this podcast have the development skills to build Ebay? And let’s be honest: granted, there’s a huge scale that you would have to deal with, but out of the gate there’s virtually no software product has to deal with scaling issues. I mean, no products have those sorts of problems out of the gate.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:52] So typically, what you do is you build a prototype or you start building this clone of somebody else’s successful product. And you do it because you either want to prove to yourself or to somebody else that you can do it or you think that you might be able to make money off of it. And the problem with it is that that’s a project. It’s not going to go anywhere because you haven’t really committed to building it into something that is going to make money. You’re essentially trying to prove to yourself that you can do exactly what somebody else did or do it better than they did.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:21] Rob: Yeah. I think a corollary that we should add to this is that an even worse idea to launch a software product is because you have a “feature idea.” Have you ever heard someone say like, “Microsoft Word is cool but it just needs to be able to do this.”? Or, “Ebay is cool but it really needs voice chat.” And so someone goes off and builds eBay and then adds voice chat and think that that’s going to make a big different. Whereas eBay can then in a week, implement voice chat and you’re out of business and they have the marketing and everything in place.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:50] Mike: Yeah, I mean there’s no feature that is compelling enough that can be added onto a product that will make that a compelling product.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:58] Rob: Reason number two.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:59] Mike: So reason number two: to get rich. We always hear about the person who wrote some stupid application that anyone with half a brain could have written and made millions. But this, in and of itself, is an awful reason to state a company, especially a software company.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:14] If you want to make a million dollars and you want to retire early, you need to do one of the following three things: either buy a lottery ticket, go to Vegas and put $500,000 on black or write a Facebook application, because that’s probably what it’s going to take. I mean, essentially, you’re gambling with your future.  And most of us are really not gamblers, or at least we prefer not to gamble with our time, that’s why some people are geared for doing start ups and Angel or VC funded companies and some people aren’t, because they’re just not interested in gambling with their future.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:44] If you’re looking for a high risk, high reward situation, then by all means: Angel and VC funder ventures are a great way to go and there’s a number of other podcasts you can listen to that you would probably enjoy a lot better than this one. But if you’re out to get incredibly rich then starting a software company probably isn’t the way to go because it’s going to take a while and it’s not going to be something that you’re going to be able to do overnight.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:04] Rob: Yeah. And I think you touched on a good point there. Even over the long term, the odds of you getting “incredibly rich” are just pretty low. The odds of making a comfortable living…\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:14] Mike: I think those are very high.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:16] Rob: I do too, especially over an investment if you stick with it long-term over several years. I think a lot of people would be able to do that. But yeah, you’re right.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:24] Mike: That’s a great way to put it, though. If you’re looking at building  a software company as an investment in your future and if you’re building these smaller applications that gradually have value or you’re able to tweak them until you get them right and you’re able to start generating recurring revenue from each of those ventures or small businesses, many businesses if you will, that is going to take your portfolio, your software company, whatever you have, whatever entity you set up behind your software products and that will grow that into a investment for you.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:57] Rob: Stupid Reason number 3: because it sounds like fun. Starting a software company is a lot of fun; it’s new, it’s exciting. But running a software company is a lot like a relationship. In the beginning everything’s new and fun, but after a while you realize it’s actually a lot of work. It’s easily three to five times more work than you ever thought it would be. Now, why is that?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:22] It’s primarily because we’re software developers and we think that the bulk of the work is in building the product, but it’s not. Only about 30% of the total effort of what it takes to launch a product is really in the development of the software itself.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:37] Once you have a product you have to worry about selling that product. And it can take a long time to get to the point where you’re actually paying yourself for the development time you put into it.  As an example, making money is fun, but do you get giddy every time you get a pay check? After a while, the novelty just wears off.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:54] Mike: It’s a lot of work. I mean, that’s the bottom line.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:56] Rob: Yeah. Starting a software company has been romanticized by a lot of the blogs we read. I started reading “Joel On Software” eight or nine years ago and I was under the impression that it was this really fun thing to do. And reading Eric Sink’s blog and a lot of these tales of people starting their software company or startup sound like it’s a ton of fun.  And I don’t think we get a lot of…\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[10:20] Mike: You don’t get the reality of it. You get the picturesque version of starting a software company from bloggers. I mean, they tell you about all the great things and you can get to see all the different places they go, and the things that they do, and the new products that they launch and you just get this heavily romanticized version of building a software company.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[10:40] What they don’t tell you about is the massive amount of bills that you have to pay that are associated with your product. I mean, they don’t tell you about the stacks and mountains of paperwork that you need to deal with at the end of the year with the IRS because they’re saying, “You owe us X amount of dollars because you made this much money last year.”  Or you’re dealing with partnerships or things like that.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[11:00] Just the paperwork issues alone are horrendous, they’re terrible and nobody ever talks about those. Nobody ever tells you that you need to file paperwork every year with the state or with the government just because you own a software company. People don’t say that sort of stuff. What you hear about is, “Oh, I launched this new product and it was successful. We had 40 billion users on the first day.” That’s the sort of stuff you hear about. You don’t have to hear about all the back end stuff that needs to get done.\\n',\n",

Frankly, because it really wouldn’t add much value and it would be kind of boring. So you’re right.  It just doesn’t present a really clear picture of it. And as a result, I think a lot of people including myself, eight or nine years, go into the business of starting a software because it sounds like fun. And that’s why Stupid Reason number 3 is because it sounds like fun.\\n',\n",

You read all these blogs and this is something of an add on to reason number three, because it sounds like fun – but you look at all these bloggers who are out there, who own their software companies and are running them, and it just seems like it’s easy; it seems like success comes easy for these people. It doesn’t seem like what they’re doing is really all that difficulty. And as I said, you get this romanticized view of running a software company, building a software company, and it’s not nearly as easy as it’s made out to be from these blogs.\\n',\n",

The interesting story that a magazine, like Entrepreneur, or Inc., or Fast Company, or Business 2.0 back in the day, the stories they’re going to write about are these anomalies that don’t happen every day.\\n',\n",

And as a result, it seems like all you have to do is write an app because all these stories about these apps are filled with wild successes.  It’s very, very rare you will see a story that is a dismal failure.  And typically, when you see one that’s about a failure, it’s always in the past. It’s what someone learned from it and how they parlayed it into their present success. Right?  Typically, someone has a success after the failure that they’re actually writing about.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[13:43] Mike: Right. I think you hit the nail on the head. All the publicity that’s around a lot of startups and software companies, they make it look easy.  And you look at what they are doing and what they have done and the thing that jumps right into your mind is, “If they can make that successful, how hard could it really be?”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[14:01] One of the things I remember from a long time ago was looking at what other people were doing and what other people building. For example, one of my earliest companies, which was not necessarily a failure but wasn’t certainly a startling success, was I started a company to build computers for people. And it’s certainly not the sexiest business in the world, building a computer, but at the time there weren’t very companies or many shops out there that were doing it.  And Dell was doing a horrendous job of it. They just could not build a machine to save their life. Everything that I worked on was always a Dell machine and they had hardware problems all over the place. Hard drives would fail left and right. Video cards would just bomb.  None of the drivers seemed to work and it was just a mess. It was a nightmare working on all this stuff.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[14:47]  And I’m like, “Well, I can do a better job than them.”  And I did. And for probably, I’d say, about two years or so I was pretty successful selling these computers. And I was making probably on average about $300 per machine that I sold. And it was great money, because at the time I was in college and I didn’t really have any other income. And I was just selling several of these computers a month and doing reasonably well.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[15:10] And it got to the point where it was just a lot of manual labor and just wasn’t really worth it anymore. I felt like Dell was a bunch of morons. That’s really what it was. And I’m like, “If they can make a successful company and they’re doing an absolutely terrible job, then how could I possibly not be successful doing almost the same thing? All I need to do is basically do what they’re doing and do it better, and how could I possibly fail?” And I won’t say that I failed, but I certainly got to the point where I just didn’t want to do it anymore. It just wasn’t interesting or fun to me anymore.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[15:42] Rob: Right. Since Dell was the darling of Wall Street and the Internet back then, I’m sure it seemed like you could just build a better computer and you would be Dell soon. And that obviously isn’t the case.  There’s more complexity to it than that.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[15:57] Now that’s we’ve talked about four stupid reasons to start a software company, let’s take a look at the right reason to start a software company.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:04] Mike: Is there only one?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:05] Rob: I think there’s only one and it’s to achieve goals that you define. So you can have multiple goals, but the reason to start a software company should be to achieve some goal or goals that you’ve decided on before you start launching that company. If you don’t have a clear understanding of what your goals are, it’s very hard to make decisions moving forward.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:29] Imagine that you’re driving west, you come to a fork in the road. Do you go left or right?  That depends on whether your destination is north or south. If you don’t have a destination in mind it’s really hard to make those decisions effectively and to move towards your goals.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:43] I think another example is if you’re starting to build a product and someone comes along and makes a suggestion and says, “Hey, don’t you think you should get investors, raise 100 grand or 500 grand, and really go big with this thing and eventually have an IPO and cash out of this thing a multi-millionaire?”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:01] That all sounds great and attractive but if, from the start, you decided that your goals were to spend more time with your family, to leave a job that you didn’t like, to live where you want, to have income flexibility, and location independence and time independence, if that’s something that you really sat down and thought about and decided that those are your goals for starting a company, then the suggestion, while it sounds interesting, is something that you probably need to turn down.  Or else, what you’ll find is that you’ll chase after this because it sounds so attractive, and six months or a year or two years down the line on your way to achieve this thing that your friend had suggested, you’re going to be really unhappy because you’re not going after what you really want and what you decided on up front.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:44] Mike: That’s kind of the difference between, “Do you want to be king or do you want to be rich?”, sort of.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:49] Rob: Yeah, that’s right. That’s a good point. And the thought behind king or rich, you want to go into what the difference is between being king or being rich?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:57] Mike: Sure. So if you want to be king then it means that you want to build up a company and you essentially want to be recognized for being the head of that company and be somewhat famous in your realm, so that speak.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:11] So, for example, Joel Spolsky is famous among developers for what he does at Fog Creek. Jason Fried at 37 Signals, same sort of thing. I mean I think that if you were to offer to buy those companies out, they would turn you down. And not so much because you wouldn’t offer them enough money, but because they enjoy being king of their domain, so to speak.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:31] Instead, if you look at somebody like Jason Cohen of Smart Bear Software, he got to a certain point where somebody came to him and gave him an offer that he just really couldn’t refuse. They said, “We’ll give you several million dollars for your company.” And he said, “Where do I sign?” because he made a decision at the very beginning that he wanted to be rich. He wanted to build his company, sell it, and then essentially retire early. And that’s exactly what he did.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:56] So the first step is to decide on your goals.  The next step is to write those goals down. A study by Dr. Gail Matthews found that people who write down their goals had a statistically higher chance of achieving those goals than people who didn’t.  And this research was based on a widely cited but completely non-existent Yale or Harvard study, based on where you hear it from, that there was supposedly 3% of the graduates had written goals at graduation day. And between 10 and 20 years later, those 3% had achieved a net worth of about 10 times what the other 97% of the graduates combined had achieved.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[19:36] And while this particular Harvard/Yale study doesn’t actually exist, the research done by Dr. Matthews shows that it really is true, not quite to the extent that this non-existent study would have had you believe. After all, I’ve never written down that I need to take a shower, but somehow I manage to get it done every single day, or at least most days.  [laughs]\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[20:00] Rob: Well, but this is an interesting point because I hate writing goals down. It feels self-helpy and it just feels like, “What if someone finds these?”, like it’s a diary or something that I don’t really want to put on paper that could be potentially be read by someone else, because it just feels vulnerable.\\n',\n",

       " '[20:22] Rob: I don’t know. If you just write them down…Let’s say I wrote them down on a piece of paper here in my office and I didn’t put them online or anything. I’m not so worried about reputation…I guess it just feels cheesy to me. It really does. I know that sounds odd, but that’s why I had never written goals down before just a couple years ago, actually. And one of the reasons I’m now a fist pounding proponent of writing them down is because this worked for me. I’m not only a client, I’m the president.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[20:51] Rob: It was! I really believe that writing down your goals is important, because a few years ago I broke down, I wrote them up, and the interesting thing is that I had forgotten about them for maybe six months or a year. And I came back to them and most of them had come true. And so, you know,  I’m not 100% sure what happened there.  I just know that I wrote those goals down and I’m very happy I did achieve them.  So I think this is a key part…\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[21:24] Mike: Well, I don’t think that writing your goals down is very much different than using some sort of project management software to keep track of all the things that you need to get done.  There are all these project management software packages out there and typically you set them up and say, “This is the goal I’m trying to reach; these are the tasks that need to be executed in order to get there.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[21:45] Rob: So one short term goal that Mike and I have discussed, one thing we propose to people who are thinking about launching their first product, is to strive to build a product that generate $1,000 a month profit with less than 2 ½ hours per week of support time.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:02] This is a reasonable and an attainable goal, and it has a number of benefits. First thing is it places a value on your time of about $100 an hour. This is also a quantifiable goal, which is a good thing.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:14] Second, the $1,000 per month revenue is not millions of dollars. It’s virtually impossible to make a huge amount of money from day one.  And if that’s what you have your sights on, you’re going to get discouraged quickly.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:26] Your first milestone is one of the hardest ones to achieve. It gets easier over time because you know more about what you’re doing, you’re going to start making fewer mistakes, but setting an achievable and quantifiable first goal is very important to making this whole process work.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:45] Mike: It’s just easier the second time around. And I think the only other thing I would add is that what you said about the first milestone being the most difficult is absolutely true. As you do things more and more, you get more comfortable with them. And repetition certainly helps. And I’m actually on my fourth business at this point and every business that I have started has done incrementally better than all the previous ones.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[23:13] And if I were to probably quantify it, I would probably say that each business that I have started is probably more successful than all the businesses I started before each of those. So my second business was more successful than my first and my third business was more successful than my first and second business combined. I think it just takes repetition and experience, and you don’t get that unless you actually get started.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[23:38] Rob: And I think the first time that you start making any money from a product that you launched or a business that you started, and whether that is $100 a month or a $1,000 dollars a month, you passed a milestone.  And the next time you try to do that with a business in the future, it’s so much easier to get there. There’s this mental hurdle that you don’t have to clear again because you’re already cleared it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[23:58] Mike: Do you think that’s because you know that it’s now possible, now that you’ve reached that $100 or $1,000 a month?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:04] Rob: I do think so. I think it has a lot to do with maybe some self-confidence and believing that you can do it, as well as the mental hurdle that we all place in front of ourselves not believing that it can be achieved.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:17] I’m sure you’ve heard the story of Robert Bannister. He’s the guy who broke the four minute mile. And people had tried for years to run a mile faster than four minutes and no one was doing it. And as soon as he did it, in the next year there were half dozen or a dozen who broke it. And for years before that, no one had done it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:36] So there’s this big mental blockade that we put in front of certain feats.  And no matter how much someone tells us, “You can make $500 a month,” or “You can launch this product,” or “You can be successful,” you just don’t believe it until you’ve done it yourself. And then once you’ve done it yourself, then that hurdle is gone; the wall’s broken down and now you can move forward much easier the second time.\\n',\n",

But something else that you can do, completely unrelated to money, is trying to get users for your product.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[25:33] There is no shortage of companies out there that are putting their software out there and choosing not to even charge people for it.  They are essentially using a free pricing model for their software.  You can choose to pay for it, donation — that sort of thing.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[25:47] But you really need to set a goal.  And whether that goal is a monetary goal or whether you just want people to use your software, people to use the things that you build.  Maybe there is a particular problem that you want to solve.  Whether you are trying to make money from that particular product or not, you need to be able to set those goals.\\n',\n",

In fact, I don’t want to make any money from this product.  The only thing I want to do is learn the process of how to take a product, build it, put it out there, and market it.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[26:18] And you can take that knowledge and, as I said, your very first milestone is the most difficult one to get to.  And if you can take a product and you build it, and it is a completely free product, you get it out there and you get 10,000 people using it, well, that sets your level of expectations for the next product that you build, because you know that you can get 10,000 people to use your product.  Although, sure, there are people who are using it for free, but there are going to be people out there who are willing to pay for your products.\\n',\n",

       " '[26:47] Rob: I think that is a good point.  It is a good reminder that this is certainly not all about money, right?  It is maybe not even a little bit about money for most people.  I mean it is about enjoying building and launching a product.  It is about learning a lot of new skills.  And ultimately, it may be about independence.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[27:04] Mike: It goes back to your goals.  It goes back to deciding on what your goals are and whether your goals are to work for yourself, work for somebody else.  It is interesting that we are talking about this, because I had somebody who was chatting with me last night online.  He is fresh out of college and wants to become a sales engineer.\\n',\n",

But one of the things that he was interested in was becoming a presales engineer.  And for somebody fresh out of college, that is very difficult.  And it has nothing to do with talent.  It has nothing to do with ability.  It has to do with where you are in your career.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

About every three or four months I went in and just kind of cleared out some dead wood, did a little bit of tune-up here and there.

You know, down the line, if you build a good product and it is two or three years down the line that people start spreading it via word of mouth, but especially for the first six to 12 months, very few people are going to be talking about it.\\n',\n",

The easiest one, if you don’t have any data, you don’t have anyone to survey, you don’t know any prospects or customers who might use this product is to do keyword research.  And we talked a little bit about that in a previous podcast.  But it is to use keyword tools to try to gage demand for certain things.\\n',\n",

Ideally, you would use that as a first step and then you would move into contacting actual people who might be interested in the product and talking to them one on one via email, or phone, or in person, and figuring out if they actually are interested in this thing and if you feel like there is a real market for this.\\n',\n",

Again, it is not for everyone, but acquiring a product can have the advantage of getting around this roadblock pretty easily.\\n',\n",

       " 'Mike: Roadblock number two is having [xx 5:40] goals.  If you don’t have clear written goals for your product, it means you don’t pay a penalty for sitting in front of your TV or RSS reader for a few hours each night.

       " 'Instead, if you specify what your goals are and track the time that you spend every single day, whether you work on your product or not, you will be able to track your progress.  It is critical that you understand and are completely aware that your week to week activities will impact your launch date for good or bad.  The intent of tracking this is to ensure that you are on target for your goals.  Remember, the reason you are doing this isn’t to beat yourself down for not getting things done.  It is to help keep you on track for meeting those goals.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Mike, what is a good way for someone to track their launch date?  First, to arrive at their launch date and have it in front of them so they are reminded of it, and then to track that on an ongoing basis.  How have you done it in the past?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I use a couple of different methods, and what works for me is not necessarily going to work for you or for anybody else.  But personally, I use a variety of different things based on the specific project that I have.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So just to throw out some of the samples of things that I use, I use a combination of Basecamp, FogBugz, Notepad, Excel.  I tried Microsoft Project in the past, but it was absolutely awful.  I couldn’t stand it.  But I also use index cards and notebooks.  I keep a separate notebook for each of the major projects that I have going on.  They are just simple one subject notebooks.  And, you know, I just write things down on them.  And if I need to, I will just translate them into a to-do list or into a FogBugz, or into Basecamp based on what it is that I write down.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Cool.  Yeah, I’ve only gone the Excel route.  I haven’t used any of the other tools.  But it has been pretty accurate for me.  I was able to define how many hours a week I was able to devote to a product.  And then over on the right-hand side, I put a big list of all the tasks that were going to get me closer to launch, and I put estimates up there.  Excel totaled those up, divided them by the number of hours I could work per week, and then it would do a calculation and it would take today’s date and it would add that number.  And it could calculate, on the fly, a dynamic launch date.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So every time I open that spreadsheet, it would update it.  And realistically, if I took a week off, then when I opened it up, the launch date was pushed out a week.  And if I took just a couple of nights off, or if I wasn’t working on the estimate items on the right-hand side that were actually getting me closer to launch, then it would creep out.  So I found it was a pretty good approach to doing it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Yeah, I think the important thing to realize is that there is no one way of doing it.  I mean each person is really going to kind of fall into their own method of figuring that out.  And I think that that is exactly why there are just so many different project management software packages on the market, is because each person has different things that are important to them and they all have their own market that they cater to.  That is why there is just so many of them, because everybody says, “Well, this piece of software doesn’t work for me because it doesn’t do X.  And some other package did do it, so that is why I use it.”\\n',\n",

       " 'Rob: Roadblock number three is inconsistency.  So the main problem with inconsistency is that it makes you lose momentum.  And momentum is critical to staying productive.  Inconsistency results from a large number of symptoms, but distractions are a major cause, and distractions are everywhere.  There are newfangled distractions that are inventing themselves all the time, and they disguise themselves as productive work.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So I am going to take a long at two causes for inconsistency.  The first on is a lack of focus.  Now, the odds are high that there are more things vying for your attention than you care to admit, including things, like I said, that masquerade as real work, things like Tweeting and reading your RSS reader.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'You really have to pay attention to how much TV and video games you consume.  How many times have you found yourself thinking you were being productive, only to look back and figure that you suddenly had spent three hours searching and evaluating something that you really didn’t need until six months down the line?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Reading tech mags and blogs is a decent way to stay informed and to kill time at your day job, but it is a terrible way to get real work done and move towards your launch.  The hard part is that it sure feels productive to read these magazines, or even to read business books; things like “Why we Buy”, and “Made to Stick”, and “Outliers”.  They are all the rage.  Everyone is talking about them.  It seems like you need to read them just to stay informed.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'In a very long-term, high level way, they do contribute to your overall knowledge of marketing and buying behavior and other things.

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So cause number two of inconsistency is over-commitment, and over commitment is a systemic thing.  It is something that takes advantage of you over time before you even realize it.  A couple years ago, I used to meet with a group of friends every Tuesday.  And then I had movie night on Wednesday, I played music on Thursday, and we typically went out for dinner on Fridays.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So by the time Friday ended, I was so exhausted I would typically watch a movie and go to sleep.  And although I didn’t appear overcommitted to my friends, who all work 9-5’s, none of them were trying to do this two job thing of working a salary job and launching a product.  So they didn’t have a second job-none of them were overcommitted, but I was.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'The problem is if you pack all these activities into your week or your month and they are recurring ongoing, you just overcommitted yourself, and it is hard to then get out of those commitments without feeling guilty.\\n',\n",

       " 'Every time someone mentions a recurring time commitment to you, you really need to think twice about taking that on.  You really need to think how it is going to impact your schedule.  Because it is fine if you think, in advance, “Oh, I am going to kill my Friday night.  I am going to have dinner with someone.”  That’s fun.  Every week, you know, it is a great personal thing, but you have to realize the impact that is going to have on your schedule.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And I do have a couple of weekly recurrences right now that I do, and I enjoy them, but I am not going to take on any more.

So it is definitely a balance, and it tends to be easier to over commit than under commit.\\n',\n",

       " 'Mike: So roadblock number four is believing that you have to do everything yourself.  I run a blog called singlefounder.com, so it seems a bit counterintuitive that I am saying this.  But you can’t do everything yourself.  The focus of my blog is to show you that you can create and run a successful business on your own.

You can do things like competitive research, keyword research, tier one email support, directory submissions.  There are a lot of other things that are related to development of your product itself that you could also outsource.  Things like HTML or CSS editing, design-that is a huge one that I think that most developers tend to think about and say, “Hey, I am just going to hire somebody to do this.”  And they don’t think about that as being something that is outsourced.  But realistically, anything that you hire somebody else to do on your behalf, that is considered a form of outsourcing.\\n',\n",

       " 'Rob: So Mike, someone listening to this might be thinking to themselves: “Wow, I have some small tasks that I might want to try outsourcing to a virtual assistant.”  And they may have no idea how to get started with this.  What do you think is kind of the first step someone needs to do in order to start outsourcing some of these tasks?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: I think that the first thing you need to do is clearly define the things that you want to outsource.  And they can be things that you want to outsource for a couple of different reasons.  One, they may be things that you just simply don’t want to do.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So, one of the things that I outsource is audio editing and video editing.  And although I enjoy video editing, it is a huge time sink.  I can spend anywhere up to two, three, four hours for a couple of minutes of audio or video.  Actually, more for video.  Audio takes a lot less time.\\n',\n",
       " 'But I can spend hours doing a short five to 10 minute video.  And, for the most part, that is if the video is done really well; if my first pass on it was very good.  If I have to cut and splice a lot of different things, it takes forever.  And, like I said, I enjoy it, but I really just can’t afford to be spending 15, 20, 30 hours editing a five minute video that I’ve got to publish.\\n',\n",

       " 'So that is just one example of something that you could outsource that is just a time sink.  And whether you enjoy it or not is kind of immaterial.  The second one, of course, you would want to outsource things that you just simply don’t enjoy doing.  A lot of people hate doing accounting, so that is why you hire an accountant.  I mean I haven’t done my taxes in, I think, about 10 years.  And the reason I don’t do it is because, one, I just hated it.  I got into engineering because I liked numbers, and I probably should have gone into accounting instead just because I like money.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'That’s the sort of thing that you can outsource.  And that is the second example.  Another example of something that you can outsource is something that you just don’t have the skill set to do.  Things that you don’t necessarily have the skill set to do would be things like designing of HTML or CSS pages for your website.  I mean I am good at putting together HTML, but when it comes to the actual design or building logos, or creating buttons, forget it.  I can do it, but the end result is not nearly as good as I would like it to be if I had a professional designer do it.\\n',\n",

I can do a better job.”  And the fact of the matter is that no matter what task it is that you are outsourcing, no matter who you give it to, you are always going to think to yourself, “Hey, I could do better than this.”  And there may be a couple of exceptions for things like graphic design, but you are always going to look at something and say, “Well, I could do better than that.  Why am I paying somebody else to do this?”\\n',\n",

If you don’t already use a desktop based time tracker that allows you to click a button and start a timer and assign that to a given task, and then click a button and have it stop when you are done, I recommend you try it out.  It is not for everyone, but I have been using SlimTimer for about three years.  And although it took me a couple of weeks to kind of get in the mindset of starting and stopping a timer all the time, once I got in the habit of it, I will never go back to doing the whole entering time into a data grid on a web form.  It just doesn’t work for me anymore.\\n',\n",

And it allows you to easily update your Excel spreadsheet that I mentioned earlier if that is the route you decide to go, or your note cards, or Basecamp, or however you want to track yourself.  This allows you to keep tabs on how you are spending your time.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And what is interesting is if you sit down and you are doing anything and your timer has not started, then you need to figure out what that time should be going to.  Because even if you are just checking email, then you should have an email task in your timer.  And if you are watching YouTube, then you should have an entertainment task in your timer.  Anytime you are at your computer, you should have that running.  And it becomes apparent pretty quickly what your big time sucks are.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'The cost structure of SlimTimer is also quite interesting.  You choose a monthly amount to pay, down to zero dollars.  So the idea is that while you are building your business, your solo startup, you can use it for free.  And then once you start making some money, you are supposed to give something back.

So I think it will be a shorter…I mean in a good way, I think it will be a shorter AB test cycle than a lot of AB tests you do.  You know, because if it is really close, it takes weeks to figure this stuff out.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:20] But, I mean when I looked yesterday, it was nine to two…Yeah, it was like 4 ½ times more; 450% more effective than our normal homepage.  Yeah, it was like embarrassing.\\n',\n",

       " '[04:29] Mike: More effective or less effective?\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:35] Rob: Less effective.  Yep.  And I certainly don’t think it’s because of the video.  I am actually considering…I mean the next step, if this video landing page doesn’t work, is to take that video and put it on my homepage and test it against the current homepage, just to see if the video draws more.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:50] Anyways, that’s what I’ve been up to.  And I mean, certainly, long-term, it will lead to improvements, even if this killer iteration doesn’t.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[04:57] Mike: Well, that’s interesting.  It will certainly be interesting to find out how well that works out for you, because I mean I think that a lot of people are trying to try other things, and video is obviously one of those things that might or might not work.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:08] My biggest concern with video is the fact that…your video probably illustrated this quite a bit…there is just so much stuff that you want to squeeze onto it and want to be able to say.  Because a video is very linear, and you and I have talked about this before — even just editing audio for other things, you have to really pay attention to that specific point time.  It is not like a web page where you go to a web page and you have complete and utter control over where you look and how you look at it.  And that’s great, because if you want to skip to the second or third paragraph of something, you can.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:40] But with a video or audio, you can’t.  You don’t have that option.  So you are forced into listening to it our watching it in whatever way somebody else wants you to.  And it is very difficult to skip ahead and to know what it is that you are skipping ahead.  You can’t skim a video, for example.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[05:58] Rob:  Yeah, that’s a good point.  It is.  It’s interesting, and that’s why I think AB testing a video versus no video is a better test than what I’m running now, because I think my landing page itself is having a negative impact, rather than the video part of it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:11] I think, in general, video will outperform other stuff as long as it’s a good video.  I think it will outperform text, but that is not going to happen in every situation.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:19] Mike: I read an article recently some place.  I wish I could remember where it was.  But it basically said that for the time being, and probably for the foreseeable future, if you create a video for something and you try to market that online, especially with Google, what will happen is your video, because there are so few videos out there, Google is tweaking their search engine such that they are mixing video results into their search results and they are weighting them a lot higher than they will regular text, because of that reason — they want it to catch on and they want people to be seeing those things in there.  And because video is difficult to search, obviously, I mean they have to do something.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[06:58] Rob: Absolutely.  Yeah. No, Google has been doing this for quite some time; maybe six months, nine months.  And that’s absolutely right.  It is.  If you put out a video and it gets quite a few views and it gets any type of clout in YouTube, then it will appear on the first page of Google.  And it is a lot easier to rank for that kind of stuff than it is for text these days.  So a lot of search engine marketers are going in that direction.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:21] You know, another interesting thing is that YouTube…I’ve heard this from two places now.  I’ve heard that YouTube is now the third largest search engine.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:29] Mike: Really?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:30] Rob: Yeah.  That that many people use it.  You know, you go to YouTube and people type in whatever — recipe, or this or that.  So it’s justification for creating some videos.  I mean that is what I am going to do.  I actually haven’t uploaded the video I created to YouTube.  It’s only in Viddler right now because of the higher quality and higher flexibility.  But I am definitely going to put it in YouTube.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:49] And there are some key things you have to do when you do it.  You have to make sure to put keywords in the title, and you have to put some links.  And there is like a description.  The first three lines display, so you kind of want a URL in there.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[07:59] So there are some key things to do to take advantage of the few thousand views you might get for something like invoicing software.  Because I put up a video probably 18 months ago, and all it is like “DotNet Invoice Invoicing software”.  And it was what we were using as our demo on our site.  And yeah, it’s gotten like 3,500 views in the past 18 months.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:16] I mean this is boring stuff, right?  Who wants to go watch a video of some guy demoing invoicing software?  And yet, a few thousand people have checked it out.  So I definitely think there is a lot to be said there for YouTube marketing.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:27] Mike: Yeah.  It depends on what they consider a view. [laughs]\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[08:39] Rob: Yeah.  Yeah, I think if it starts to play, they count it as a view; maybe five seconds or something.\\n',\n",

       " '[08:48] Rob: So today’s topic is: Eight things we wish we knew when we started out.  And you and I have set down and we’ve put together our list of eight things that we wish we knew when we became entrepreneurs and started companies and launching products.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:03] And I think some of these will not come as a surprise to people listening but will be shocking revelations.  So I’ll get started with the first one.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:11] I wish that I knew that having traffic to a website isn’t enough to succeed.  I wish I knew that when I started out, because I was under the impression that you could launch a product or a website and if you just got enough people to come to that website that that was it; that’s all you needed.  I mean you needed a decent product or a compelling website, but it just turned out that that is so far from the truth it’s not even funny.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:34] Traffic quality is a huge deal in terms of having actual targeted traffic, and so much time…I mean to me it is like a two part equation.  There is traffic and then there are conversions.  And getting people to convert is as difficult or even more difficult than just generating traffic.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[09:53] These days, I almost feel like generating traffic is an easier task.  Like, once you get something converting, there are all sorts of avenues to get traffic.  You can use AdWords, you can do SEO, you can create videos like we’ve talked about, you can go on podcasts, you can start a blog.  I mean all of these things are going to funnel traffic, even if it is a few hundred visitors to start with.  But I really do think that that is the easy part.  It is getting a compelling offer and getting people to buy your product, or at least give you their email or kind of opt-in to getting to know you better.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[10:23] Mike: That’s definitely something that if we had more than eight things, that would be on my list as well.  You are absolutely right.  I mean traffic is just absolutely not enough.  And you really need to know a lot more about the traffic that is coming to your website and be able to do something with it.  I mean you can get 10,000 or 100,000 visitors to your site, but unless they are doing what it is that you want them there for, it just doesn’t matter.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[10:46] Rob: Yeah.  I remember the first time my blog was on the front page of Digg.  I got around 50,000 visitors in about 2 ½, three days.  And I thought, “Oh my gosh!  My RSS subscriptions are just going to shoot through the roof.”  And I don’t remember what I was at at the time; probably 1,500 or 2,000 RSS subscribers.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[11:03] And I think it went up between 100 and 200 subscribers.  And I thought to myself, “Oh my gosh, that is just nothing!  That is nothing compared to what it should have gone up if I was able to convert those people.”  And I think that has a lot to do with the traffic quality from Digg, right?  They are not typically going to subscribe.  They are more of a smorgasbord type buffet.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",

       " '[11:59] Rob: Right.  That’s true.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[12:01] Mike: One of the things that I think that I really wish I had known when we started out, or when I started out, was the amount of administrative overhead that it takes to not only create, but to run a business.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[12:13] When I first got started, I actually did things the official, “government approved” way.  I went out, I got an attorney, I got a CPA and filled out all the paperwork, which there was a lot of.  And as time went on, that paperwork got to be more and more.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[12:30] And it’s just a huge administrative headache to run a business.  And the thing that sucks the most is there are all these things that people don’t even tell you that you have to do.  For example, if you have a corporation, you have to file a yearly…I forget exactly what it is.  It is just basically a yearly form that you file with the state or the Federal government that says, “This corporation is still in existence.”  And typically, in a larger or public company, you would have somebody who does that for you, because they take minutes and they submit them to the state and say that, “Yes, we are continuing to do business.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[13:02] But as a small company, you don’t have the luxury of having somebody else who keeps on track of all the state and federal guidelines that you need to follow in order to maintain the business as a recognized business.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[13:15] And if you don’t keep on that stuff, you can actually lose your status as a business and the IRS can come at you and say, “Well, you are not really running a business because you haven’t filed all this paperwork.”  So they will start nailing you for massive taxes and you won’t get any of those tax shelters that a normal business would offer you.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[13:32] In addition, there are all these other things that you need to do such as keeping bank statements separate.  So all your business expenses have to be separate from your personal expenses.  Anything that you are going to write off, you need to document that.  If you go out to dinner and you talk to somebody, you have to write down on the receipt exactly what it was that you talked about.  You have to keep track of all this stuff in QuickBooks because, let’s be honest, an Excel spreadsheet is just not enough.  And the government is going to look at that and they are going to say, “Well, you know what?  We don’t accept an Excel spreadsheet as an official document for keeping track of all of the things that you supposedly wrote off during the year.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[14:07] Because you can write anything you want in there.  And, granted, you can sort of do the same thing in QuickBooks if you know what you are doing, but it is a little bit more difficult if you have to keep track of all those receipts and stuff.  The amount of time and effort that goes into making sure that you maintain everything in the official, approved way is just ridiculous.  And it takes so much time that you don’t actually spend nearly as much time as you want to on your business itself.  So whether you are trying to build a product, or marketing it, or anything, anything that actually  contributes to your bottom line, it takes away from that.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[14:38] Rob: I take your comment on the Excel spreadsheet as a personal and deliberate attack on my approach.  Mike knows very well that I manage…I am the polar opposite.  I started my business about eight years ago and I run everything in Excel.  I am totally loosey-goosey with it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[14:53] Mike: But your situation is different.  My business started out as an S Corporation.  So I have some different requirements that I have to follow.  And as I have two S Corporations, I have to do it for each of them and I have to keep them completely separate from all of my personal stuff.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[15:36] But I did get a CPA a few years ago.  But, yeah, Mike and I have taken a different approach to it.  He went with the S Corp up front. And even then, I use Excel; I don’t use QuickBooks.  I’m going to have to move to it soon. But even then, I still feel like there is a ton of overheard, especially with taxes and just all the paperwork that I have to file with the city and the dba thing that has to be done every couple of years.  So I agree with you.\\n',\n",

       " '[16:00] Mike: Just a quick note.  If you are going to go  with the 2010, get the “QuickBooks 2010: The Official Guide”.  I got the one for 2008 because that is back when I first bought it.  But that is a very good reference manual, because QuickBooks is kind of confusing, especially if you are not an accountant.  And “Accounting for Dummies” is another good one to help you figure out, like, the double-entry accounting and how all that stuff works.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:22] Rob: Right.  Good tips.  I’ve actually been looking at Clarity Accounting, I think it’s called, and it’s a QuickBooks Online competitor.  So I may go with that just because I don’t need heavy duty stuff; I really just need some basic double-entry.  And Clarity is less expensive, but that’s not the reason I am going with it.  It is just way more flexible; it appears to be anyways.  And the UI is a lot better.  It is made by tech people; tech people who know accounting.  Whereas to me, QuickBooks is just almost like made by accountants.  It’s just so clunky when I’ve used it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[16:54] Mike: Yeah, the one nice thing about QuickBooks is you can hand it off to virtually any CPA on the planet and they all know how to use it.\\n',\n",

       " '[17:00] Rob: Yeah, that’s the thing I am going to ask my CPA before I go with this move.  I have a bookmark right now, but I am going to ask him.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:05] Mike: Yeah.  I asked my CPA  about it and he said either Peachtree or QuickBooks.  He said about one out of 10 of his customers used Peachtree and nine out of 10 use QuickBooks.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:15] Rob: Yeah, that makes sense.  Number three on the list of things we wish we knew when we started out is that one big link won’t make you successful.  This is an ongoing myth that I keep hearing about it.  I’ve blogged about  it.  And even now when I talk to people, I will hear a developer who is going to launch a product, and he will say, “Man, all I need is that link from Tech Crunch.  All I need is that link from Joel on Software.  All I need is to get mentioned on Seth Godin’s blog or mentioned on this podcast.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[17:42] And I hate to break it to you — it doesn’t matter.  It just doesn’t work out that way.  That will give you a few thousand visitors, but, frankly, even before you get those visitors, you really want to work on conversions.  So if you get those few thousand visitors, that fire hose of visitors from one of these links, and your site is not already optimized to help get people along in your purchase process, then it’s just not going to matter.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:06] Mike: Number four on the list is: You can’t do everything yourself.  Outsourcing time-consuming tasks is going to be essential to making sure that you are successful.  And I’ll give you a prime example.  The first one I started out with was the amount of administrative overhead that it takes to create and run a business.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:23] Well, when I hired my first full time employee, we started looking into getting health insurance.  And when you are applying for health insurance as a small business, because, you know, obviously the business provides health insurance to all of the employees and I was one of the employees, and I wanted my own health insurance because my wife was leaving her job.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:41] Long story short.  The problem I ran into was that when you get into a problem like that, it is completely an administrative problem and it contributes absolutely nothing to your bottom line.  But it has still got to get done and you want it to get done right.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[18:55] So what I did was I actually handed it off to my employee and said, “You know what?  The primary reason for us getting this health insurance is for you,” because I had it through my wife and we would have gotten a discount for the business if it had gone through the company instead.  But we needed at least two people on the plan.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[19:10] I was like, “You know what?  This is important to you, so pick a plan.  You know, you are the one who is going to be responsible for finding health insurance for the company.  And make sure you pick correctly because, obviously, you are going to have to live with the consequences of that.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[19:22] Which obviously works out, but at the same time, I mean choosing health insurance is very, very time consuming.  And it is worth looking at that at least once a year, when you are up for your renewal, looking around to see what else is out there.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[19:36] But that’s something that I just…I essentially outsourced it to my employee, but I certainly could have taken that task…If I were a single employee, I could have gone to an insurance agent and said, “Hey, please find me something that is going to work for me.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[19:49] And there are lots of other things that you can outsource as well, and they range from things like doing your accounting, doing some of your marketing, copy writing, building a website, building CSS templates for your website, creating images.  I’m a developer.  I know a little bit about how to use Photoshop, at least enough to get by and build things.  But it is certainly not going to be as good as somebody else.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[20:12] And there have also been times where I just did not have enough time in the day.  I mean I outsourced mowing my lawn to a professional agency because I just did not want to do it, because it was sucking up about an hour, an hour and a half, two hours of my time every week, and it was just ridiculous.  I am like, “I don’t have that time to spend.”  So I hired somebody to do it for me at like $50 an hour and just said, “Here.  Go nuts.”  It wasn’t $50 an hour.  It was like $50 every time they came, but still…\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[20:52] Rob: Right.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Yeah, you know, I think there are two types of outsourcing that I’ve encountered.  One is when you outsource something because someone else has more expertise than you do.  And in that case, you may actually pay more than what you’ve monetized your time at, because they will do it better.  Someone like a lawyer, as an example, instead of writing a document, you are going to pay them a couple hundred bucks an hour, but that may be worth it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[21:14] And then there is the outsourcing of tasks that you could do, but ideally, you are going to pay less than your monetized hourly rate.  And that is things like you said.  Mowing your lawn is a personal task, but all of the virtual assistant tasks that you and I outsource, audio editing, video editing, front line email support, web design, on and on…\\n',\n",

       " '[21:55] Mike: [laughs]  One of the things that I found was that…And I got really hung up on this, was the fact that I knew that I could do a better job than anyone else than whatever it was, because it was important to me for certain things.  So building a web page, for example.  Making sure that all the CSS was tweaked exactly right.  And I knew that I wanted it done in a certain way, and I knew that I would do it better than somebody else, because I just cared so much more.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:20]  But the problem with that is that you are not really being a manager of your business at that point.  What you are doing is you are getting down into the dirty details and you are doing things that you really just have no business doing.  And not because you care more or you don’t have the skill set, but because there are more important things for you to be spending your time on.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:38] And even if somebody only does it 80% as well as you do, or 75%, or 60%, the fact is that it is saving you time, and that is the bottom line.  That’s what it comes down to, because time is one of your most precious assets when you are trying to build out your business.  And that is why you outsource these things.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[22:56] Rob: The fifth thing we wish we knew when we started out is to think in years rather than months.  It is a common mistake to feel like you can build a project in two or three months, launch it, have a big success, and, you know, within six months be making a few thousand bucks a month.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[23:12] Well, that may happen; it is very unlikely.  It is going to be a lot longer slog than that.  Even the developers I’ve seen who have done it really well and have applied their knowledge, and invested time and money, and just launched a product that was in a good niche, and really nailed a lot of things, typically, the development is about four to six months, and then they will launch, and the ramp up to a reasonable amount of revenue is another three to six months, at least.  This is like a minimum if you do everything right.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[23:42] So it really does come out to between seven and twelve months, just if you are doing everything right, to kind of get  $500 to $1,000 a month going.  And if you make any slip ups or if you are in a market that maybe is a little difficult to penetrate, there is higher SEO competition, it’s definitely going to take you into the years.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:00] And I think that we are in an unprecedented time here.  That being able to start a business on your own is like nothing in history that has ever existed.  And, in addition, even being able to think in terms of seven to 12 months or 12-18 months as a time frame for getting a business going and being profitable, making some money every month, that is really unprecedented.  It’s an incredible time that we live in.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:25] But with that said, don’t get carried away and don’t think that we are so unprecedented that it’s like, “Oh, I am going to get this done in 90 days and I am going to be making $2,000 a month.”  It is very unlikely to happen.  The outliers like Peldi who launched Balsamiq and made several hundred thousand dollars in his first year, it’s just a one in 10,000 chance, and it is just so very unlikely to happen to you.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[24:48] Mike: That’s a really important piece.  People that you see online who are doing that, they are outliers.  And that’s just what is so misleading about it, because you look at these people who are out there who are successful at it and you think, “Oh, I could do that.”  And you start down that road, and unless you have that plan in place that matches the specific time line that you are talking about, you know, at least seven to 12 months, or 12-18, or 18-36 months, I mean if you’ve got a time line in your head that is easier measured in weeks than in months, there is probably a serious flaw in your business plan.  I mean it is just…It is not realistic.  Not to say it is impossible, but it is just not as realistic.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[25:29] So number six on the list is: Don’t waste time making the optimal decision.  Make a decent decision and move on.  And this goes back to, in fact, just a couple of minutes ago.  You and I were talking about it.  You had asked me whether I was paying $50 an hour or $50 per month for somebody coming in to mow the lawn.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[25:49] And, at the time, I mean I was well aware that the decision that I was making to pay this money was not worth me shopping around.  It was for somebody to come in in the summer and do it, and I just needed it taken care of, and it was not worth my time and effort to sit there and either haggle over the price or bring in a bunch of different people and do bids over it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[26:10] It just wasn’t worth the time.  It’s almost like sitting there and spending a couple of hours trying to figure out: “Should I buy this hard drive or should I buy that hard drive?”  And the difference between them is really negligible, and the price difference is, I don’t know, say $25.  Well if you spend more than an hour or two hours trying to figure this out, it was just not a good use of your time.  I mean you should have just bought the more expensive one and moved on, because at that point, you have already wasted more than $25.  And by buying the more expensive one, now you are out $25 plus the extra time that you spent on it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[26:44] So make a decision about what to do and just move on.  You are not going to do yourself any favors by making an optimal decision 90% of the time.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[26:54] Rob: The next item on our list is number seven, and it is that marketing and sales take as long to learn as software development.  The bottom line is that building software products is not the same as launching them.  It is not the same as marketing them and selling them to someone.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[27:10] So if someone spent two years or five years, 10 years, learning how to write code and build a product, it doesn’t necessarily  mean that they know how to actually take that product to market and make it successful.  And it will take literally years to learn how to do that.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[27:27] There is a reason that there are MBA programs in marketing.  A lot of developers, including myself when I first started, will look at a marketing program and say, “Oh, that’s just a bunch of BS.  What do you need to know?  It’s common sense.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[27:38] And to a certain extent, that’s true, but there are so many things that you learn as you go through it, and there are so many things you can learn from someone who has more experience than you, from books, blogs, and interacting with people who are launching products.  And then from launching your own, of course.  I mean experience is the number one thing you are going to learn from, just like with software development.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[27:57] I’m sure when you first started out as a developer, if you are like me, you read some books and you wrote a bunch of code, and over the years you got better.  And that’s how you have to look at it when you are marketing and selling your own product, is that you have to take some resources and absorb them, and then you have to do it on your own and learn as you go along.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[28:16] But you are not going to be an expert.  You aren’t going to be a journeyman marketer the first day you step out of the game, just like you weren’t an expert coder the first day that you started writing, “Hello world”.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[28:29] Mike: That’s an important distinction between building a project and launching a product, because most of the people who are listening to this podcast, I’m going to assume, are mostly developers.  Not all of them, but most of them.  And in order to become an expert of those sorts of things, the general consensus on what it takes to become an expert in a given field is around 10 years of consistently working in that field or about 10,000 hours or so.  And if you ballpark 10,000 hours into working hours, that’s realistically about five years full time doing something.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[29:01] Now, because we are developers, you know, we probably went to school for this sort of thing, we get a lot of that extra time built into it.  We don’t come out of college with five years of experience; let’s be honest.  But we do come out of it with a certain amount of expertise.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[29:18] And going back to the distinction between building a product and launching a product, we’ve got that building a product down.  We know how to build a product by the time we get out of college and into the real world.  And there is probably a great many things that we don’t really understand about, such as the target market, and what people are really looking for, and why you can’t do things a certain way.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[29:39] So as you start building products, if you work for a company that actually ships products as opposed to most developers who probably write internal software and internal applications, but the companies that build products, when you get in there and you start building code for those, they have a set of processes and rules in place that are more informal than anything else, but they say, “You can’t do X.”  And there is a reason you can’t do it, and it is because the product doesn’t sell well.  0:30:05] And you don’t understand at first, but, over time, you gradually figure it out and you learn these things as time goes on.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[30:12] The same thing goes with marketing and being able to launch a product.  Because launching a product is just so completely different, you have to learn some of these things.  And it can take years to become essentially what amounts to being an expert at marketing.  And you have to be able to do both.  You have to be able to build that product, and once you are done building a product, you have to become an expert at marketing and selling that product.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[30:36] So the last one of our list of eight things we wish we knew when we started out is: If it’s easy in the beginning, that will probably change.  And if it’s not easy, that’s entirely normal.  It’s very rare that you launch a product or you launch a service and it’s immediately very, very successful.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[30:54] A lot of times you will see these companies that are either Angel funded or investor funded and they come out of the gate and they seem super strong, and you watch them grow and they become phenomenal successes.  And it looks like they do it almost overnight.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[31:10] But the difference between them and you is that they had millions of dollars to throw at a problem and you probably don’t.  So if you’re trying to grow organically, it’s not going to be easy.  Even if you have lots of money, it’s not always easy.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[31:23] I mean there are tons of companies that burn through millions and millions of dollars every day and they end up fizzling out because either the market was a failure or their product was terrible.  Something happened in the market that made them end up going out of business, they ran into legal issues, or the founders fought and the whole company went to heck.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " '[31:42] But it’s not typical for those companies to just come out of the gate and be wildly successful from day one.  It takes a lot of hard work, and hard work implies that it’s just not easy.\\n',\n",

And I got a new job board rolled out.  You know, I already had the software for the other job board.  So, it’s been fun.  It’s been neat.  I think it’s been a total investment of my time of around six hours or seven hours, and I’ve probably spent $100 on VA time.  And maybe I’ll be at $200 by the time we launch.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: So in this week’s episode, we are going to talk about how to find a niche.  So regardless of how you say it, there is a small market segment that you want to be going after in a lot of cases, I mean unless you want to start competing against the big boys.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But I think in this episode, we are really going to focus in on how to find those small niche markets that are going to generate money for you.  And it may not be tens of thousands or millions of dollars a month or anything like that, but the goal is to get a substantial revenue from that, or a consistent revenue, I should say.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Yeah, and I think there are a lot of misunderstandings about niches, or just kind of a lot of myths floating around.  There is this famous Eric Sink quote, and he says that, “If there is no competition in a market, if there is no competition in a niche, that niche is too small.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And while that might hold true if you are  a venture-backed firm or even if you are just a smaller traditional software company like SourceGear, which has, what, 50 employees now?  100 employees?  Or Fog Creek Software which has 30…\\n',\n",

       " 'Rob: Yeah.  Or even just a tiny software company where you are going to hire five or 10 people, that might actually be true, the fact that, you know, you need competition; if there is no competition, it is probably not a big enough market.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'However, the niches we are talking about and the business models we are talking about are micropreneur business models.  And as we talked about in our first episode, a micropreneur is a one person company; it’s a one person business.  And so, a niche that generates even $500, or $1,000, or $2,000 a month would be totally overlooked, and rightfully so, by a real software company that has payroll, and overhead, and leases and such.  But when you are one person, another $1,000 a month is pretty cool!  You may not make a living off that.  Some people can live off that, but others won’t be able to.  But if you get a few of these products together, which is what I’ve done over the past several years, you can totally make a living off of this stuff.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So I think that is the big caveat that we need to say upfront, is that when we talk about niches, we really do talk about fairly small niches.  And they may be up to $5,000 or $10,000 a month, but I would encourage someone, especially a first-time micropreneur, to go out and try to tackle, really, a $10,000 to $20,000 a month niche.  I just think there is going to be too much competition.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So let’s take, for example, a database.  If you have some special format for a database that works really well for a particular problem, that’s a great niche to have, because although somebody could use Oracle or MySQL or SQL Server, and those are reasonable options to use in many cases, if you have a very specific need for this particular database, let’s say it stores binary files really, really well, that would be a great niche to go after, because you have this database.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Actually, I saw, probably six or seven years ago, was this freeform database, and I forget who the vendor was.  But essentially, they touted it as a database where you could dump data in it and you didn’t really have to specify types of anything, and it would be able to handle all that for you and make things searchable.  And it worked really well.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

You had Access.  You had SQL Server.  You had…I don’t think Oracle had their free version out at the time.  But again, there is all this competition in a broad base market.  But because of their particular problem space, they were just saying, “If you need a freeform database, this is your tool.”\\n',\n",

       " 'Rob: I think that brings up an interesting point when talking about niches.  There are horizontal and vertical niches.  And we should probably talk about what those mean.  I think some people might not have heard of them.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'So a horizontal market niche cuts across multiple industries.  The industries are these vertical things that a horizontal one cuts across.  So a good example is Microsoft Word.  It is very horizontal because anyone in any industry could use it.  And then there are word processors that are industry specific.  There is one made for professors and people writing research papers, and it handles all types of citations and other stuff.  And so that would be a vertical word processor.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: Typically more, actually.  I think the one that I’ve seen is like $300 or $400 for the niche word processor, because it is the only one that does the job.  And it doesn’t sell a ton of copies.  So, yeah, there tends to be a few benefits to going with vertical niches.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And I should also take a step back and say that vertical niches are not just in industries.  It could also be in hobbies.  You know, a hobby could be considered vertical.  And so I think you and I would probably recommend that people don’t go after horizontal niches, right?  I mean I think, in general, it is a tough approach.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'I know that with Dot Net Invoice, my product, that is a horizontal, because anyone in most any industry could use it.  And we’ve struggled with figuring out the best way to market it, because I really can’t go and pick a website or a single magazine or trade-pub and advertise in it and on that industry.  And we’ve been in a lot of talks about making vertical versions of Dot Net Invoice.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: Yeah, I would totally agree with that.  I mean the other thing about a vertical niche market is that you don’t have to worry as much about your competitors, because in the case that you gave earlier of the word processing software, it was designed for researchers.  So although Microsoft Word can do all of those things, it just doesn’t do it as well.  So they can justifiably charge more because they can do a feature by feature comparison of Microsoft Word and their product and say, “We do these things really well.  And Microsoft Word can do them, but it is a real pain in the neck.  So the extra money that you are paying us is for the conveniences and the time savings that you are going to experience by buying our product.”\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'And I think the same thing goes for your product as well.  I mean if you were to gear it directly at martial arts studios, for example, that is a great niche, because how many martial arts software packages are out there that do invoicing that you can think of?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Rob: If you attack this vertical, A, you can build features that cater so well to your audience that they love you.  I mean you literally will get people writing an email saying like, “This is fantastic.”\\n',\n",

You may have lower volume, but your conversion rate is going to be a heck of a lot higher because you can find targeted traffic, and it is going to be less expensive if you pay for advertising and easier to SEO optimize.  And easier to search engine optimize.  Sorry.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'I have a question for you; I think a question that is probably running through a lot of people’s minds.  We are talking about vertical niches and we are talking about staying relatively small so that you don’t get in the way of these larger companies.  How small is too small?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Mike: “How small is too small?” is a relative question.  If you were to take a look at a specific industry, like, if you were making software for astronauts, there is, what, maybe 100 astronauts in the world if you are including the ones from Russia, and China, and whoever else is trying to make it into space?  There is, what, 100, 200 maybe?\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But of those 100-200, the questions that come up are, one, how many of them are going to purchase your product, and two, what is the price point?  So those are extremely important, because if you only reach one of them, let’s say you are building this space agency software that is only written in English.  How many space agencies in the US are going to buy that?  I can think of one off the top of my head.  And maybe those rest of them that are in the Southwestern US that are trying to put something into space, maybe they would buy it too.  But realistically, you’ve got one, and that’s NASA.  That’s one possible customer.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'But, that software that you sell them could be $20 million.  So assuming your conversion rate is 100% on that, then great. You’re doing well. But if it is zero, then you’re not. So I think it is very much a relative question around, it’s not so much how many people might buy your software, but how many people would be interested in it, what’s the price point, and what kind of conversion are you going to get? Because if you can get a conversion rate upwards of 80%, 90%, you are doing great, almost regardless of the price point.\\n',\n",

Your maximum profit is probably about $6 billion. And if everyone on the planet buys one, you’ll make about $6 billion. How many of those people are actually going to buy it?  It essentially puts a cap on what your total income could be.

      "[Document(page_content='[25:57] The weird part about it is you can say, OK, well just price your Kindle book at $9.99. But then that totally undercuts all your other sales channels. If you’re selling a hardback or a paperback, or even a PDF EPUB version like I do, if you’re selling those for 24 bucks direct, then you charge $9.99, you’re going to totally just undercut those sales. So it’s really an interesting paradigm. I can see why publishers are having kind of a conniption over it.\\n \\n [26:22] [music]\\n \\n [26:26] Ilya: Hey, guys. My name is Ilya. I’m a student and I’m a software developer who’s trying to launch several products. In one of your podcasts you’ve mentioned that to get your website started from zero to X number of visitors, you said that you need to create a landing page and just basically collect email addresses.\\n \\n [26:45] This is my main concern. When the product is ready, how do I get people to use it? Can you possibly provide some more tips on the subject? Thank you very much, by the way.\\n \\n [26:55] Rob: This is actually a pretty common question. It’s a good question. I’m glad it came in.\\n \\n [27:00] It seems like Ilya’s question was two-fold. One was about how do I get that initial first few hundred visitors/users? How do I start from nothing and get people to come? And part two is how do I do a landing page? And I think he’s implying that the landing page can help you get those first few hundred visitors or users, which, of course, it can.\\n \\n [27:22] So I think there’s a process here that works. There’s kind of a design pattern. The steps are like this: when you have an idea for a product, you figure out a domain name, you register it, and you get a landing page up as soon as possible.', metadata={}), Document(page_content='[14:46] So something that we just pound into people is the critical nature of as soon as you know your product idea, register your domain name and get a site up. The first reason is because Google gives you more credibility the longer your site has been up, and you can start working on SEO immediately. So you find your target keywords and you get some content up there that’s going to draw people in. Again, the longer it’s there the more clout you’re going to get.\\n \\n [15:11] And get a landing page up. Start collecting e mails of people who are interested in your product.  Have a blurb about your product and start drawing traffic through SEO and through your blog. Even if your blog is not wildly popular, you blog about the things that are interesting and those things will draw traffic from Google.\\n \\n [15:27] And if there are niche websites in the niche that you’re targeting, such as if you’re targeting startups, obviously you want to get your blog posts on Hacker News, and that will drive traffic to your blog, and that will get people over to your website as you mention it on there.\\n \\n [15:40] Or if you target Photography Now, and you try and get your blog post published there. Do a guest post for a popular photographer blog. And it just routes traffic back. And over the course of six months, as you build your product, you can build a mailing list of hundreds and hundreds of people who are interested in your product launch.\\n \\n [15:58] And so it’s amazing what a few hundred e mails on your list will do to boost your confidence. Because not only do you know that people are interested and that they’re going to be likely to buy your product, assuming you’ve given a good description of it on the landing page, but you know that the first day that you launch, that you’re going to sell some copies, that you’re going to make some real money from all of this effort that you’ve put forth.', metadata={}), Document(page_content='[14:06] Rob: Absolutely, and that conversion rate on that mailing list traffic, assuming it is targeted, you can easily get 5% conversion rate on that list; 5% of people will buy your product.  And it’s completely within the realm of possibility to get 15% or 20%, if they’re interested in your product.  You can have your best sales day ever on the very first day that you launch if you build a mailing list well.\\n \\n [14:31] This is one of the most important recommendations I make to entrepreneurs, specifically software developers, who ask me, “What can I do to help my product succeed?”  It’s to get started with a bang and don’t just launch your product by opening your website on day one and sell to one out of 100 people.  Have a mailing list.\\n \\n [14:51] I’ve known several micropreneurs who’ve launched with mailing lists of 500 or even 1,000 interested prospects.  And no joke, you sell 100 copies of your product on the first day because you send out an email blast and you give them a little bit of a discount for being on the mailing list, you’ll have a very exciting launch, and it will give you a lot of mental momentum to continue improving the product and move forward with it.\\n \\n [15:14] Mike: And that discount is actually different from what we talked about before where there’s a discount for signing up for a mailing list, which we think is probably a bad idea in general, but if you give people a discount that you have not told them about previously to entice them to get them to sign up for the mailing list, that’s a completely different story.  There’s two entirely different ways of looking at that.\\n \\n [15:35] Rob: Yeah, that’s a good point.', metadata={}), Document(page_content='[17:30]  It works especially well if they have an aged website, because that’ll help you with search engine authorization later.  Especially if they have an out of date website or product, because realistically, updating that product . . . Let’s say they have a desktop version, you can add a SaaS component, or you can just update the desktop version and make it better.\\n \\n [17:47] There could be some opportunity there for you.  Obviously, you still have to check the niche out and do all the research on it.   I have had a low level of success with this approach.  I did a cold email campaign about two and a half years ago where I had a couple of niches picked out, and I noticed there was already quite a bit of competition in all of the niches.  So I emailed everyone.  I got a few responses back.\\n \\n [18:11] It turns out that when you’re trying to buy, when you’re on the buy side, and people don’t know these multiples that apps typically sell for, like on Flippa, it’s pretty tough to convince someone that if their app makes $1,000 a month that they need to sell it for between $4,000 and $18,000.  That just sounds really low, especially if you’ve spent a year or two building it.  That turned out to be one challenge.\\n \\n [18:34] The other one is I just didn’t get a lot of responses.  A lot of people aren’t interested in selling their app.  It makes sense.  I think I sent out maybe 30 emails over the course of a month.  I did get probably four or five replies.  So it’s a pretty good hit rate.\\n \\n [18:47] But I did have good luck of acquiring a product kind of through this method.  It was actually just keeping my eyes out.  Someone posted on the forums they had this great .NET product and they were having trouble with marketing.  They were looking for a partner to help them market it.  I basically offered to purchase it from them instead.  And that product is .DotNet Invoice, which most of you know, I’ve owned for several years.', metadata={})]\n"
